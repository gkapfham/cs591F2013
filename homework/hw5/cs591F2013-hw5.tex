\MYTITLE{Homework Assignment Five: Installing and Configuring AppInventor}
\MYHEADERS{Homework Assignment Five}{Due: October 24 and 25, 2013}

\section*{Introduction}

In this homework assignment, we will investigate the use of new tools for implementing mobile applications for the
Android operating system.  In particular, we will focus on the AppInventor system developed jointly by Google and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  You can learn more about AppInventor by visiting the Web site
\url{http://appinventor.mit.edu/} and browsing the chapters in the AppInventor textbook provided by the course
instructor.

\section*{Installing and Configuring AppInventor}

Before you start this assignment, please make sure that you are sitting at a laboratory computer that has a USB cable
available for your use.  Furthermore, you must ensure that when you checkout your Nexus 7 tablet you also take the USB
cable that is used to connect it to the power supply.  After logging into your workstation, carefully connect your 
tablet to the workstation's USB cable.

When you go the settings section of the Android operating system, you will notice that the ``Developer options'' menu
item is not currently available to you.  Since we need this tab and the features that it provides, you will need to investigate
how to enable it for the ``Jelly Bean'' version of Android.  What trick did you discover?  Once the discover how to
enable this menu, please turn on USB debugging and take a screen shot to demonstrate that you have completed this task.
