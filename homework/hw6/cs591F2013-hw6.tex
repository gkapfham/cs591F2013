\MYTITLE{Homework Assignment Six: Components and Blocks in AppInventor}
\MYHEADERS{Homework Assignment Six}{Due: October 31 and November 1, 2013}

\vspace*{-.1in}
\section*{Introduction}

In this homework assignment, we will use the Component Designer and the Blocks Editor to create a simple mobile app that
can play sounds and perform actions when you either touch or shake the tablet.  As in the previous homework assignment,
you should take time to learn more about AppInventor and get ready to program your app by visiting the Web site
\url{http://appinventor.mit.edu/}. Students who want to learn more about the AppInventor system or download a PDF of
today's printed chapter should also visit \url{http://www.appinventor.org/}.

\section*{Using the Component Designer and the Blocks Editor}

Following the tutorial in the handout provided by the instructor, use the Component Designer and the Blocks Editor
to create an app that displays an image and reacts when the user manipulates the tablet.  You should use the Component
Designer when you want to add both visible (e.g., buttons and labels) and non-visible (e.g., sounds and sensors)
components to your mobile app.  Using the Component Designer involves dragging components from the list of those
available to the canvas of your mobile app.  You can use the Blocks Editor when you want to program the logic that
describes how the user interface components will behavior when subject to interaction. Using the blocks editor involves
the assembly of ``puzzle pieces'' that describe your mobile app's behavior.

After you have reviewed the printed version of Chapter 1 in the AppInventor text book, you should implement the
described application, adding your own extensions in several areas.  For instance, instead of adding the picture of a
cat, you should pick a different picture.  Then, you should select sounds that will work well with your chosen picture.
Finally, you should implement one or two additional features by adding components and blocks that are not specifically
mentioned in Chapter 1 of the AppInventor book. Once you have completed your app, you should package it for download to
the Nexus 7 tablet.  Before packaging the app, please make sure that you have designed a high-resolution icon that will
be associated with your app when it is run on the tablet.

Does your app work correctly when your tablet is not connected by the USB cable to the development workstation? Now that
you have finished implementing your first app in AppInventor, please take some time to reflect on your experiences.
What are the strengths and weaknesses associated with using AppInventor? What are three apps that you could
implement in AppInventor?
