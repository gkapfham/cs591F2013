\MYTITLE{Homework Assignment Six: Using Components and Blocks in AppInventor}
\MYHEADERS{Homework Assignment Six}{Due: October 31 and November 1, 2013}

\vspace*{-.1in}
\section*{Introduction}

In this homework assignment, we will use the Component Designer and the Blocks Editor to create a simple mobile app that
can play sounds and perform actions when you either touch or shake the tablet.  As in the previous homework assignment,
you should take time to learn more about AppInventor and get ready to program your app by visiting the Web site
\url{http://appinventor.mit.edu/}. Students who want to learn more about the AppInventor system or download a PDF of
today's complete assignment should also visit the \url{http://www.appinventor.org/} Web site.

\section*{Using the Component Designer and the Blocks Editor}

Follow the tutorial in the handout provided by the course instructor to use the Component Designer and the Blocks Editor
to create an app that displays an image and reacts when the user manipulates the tablet.  You should use the Component
Designer when you want to add both visible (e.g., buttons and labels) and non-visible (e.g., sounds and sensors)
components to your mobile app.  Using the Component Designer involves dragging components from the list of those
available onto the canvas of your mobile app.  You can turn to the Blocks Editor when you want to program the logic that
describes how the user interface components will behavior when subject to interaction. Using the blocks editor involves
the assembly of ``puzzle pieces'' that describe your mobile app's behavior.
