\MYTITLE{Homework Assignment Four: Implementing and Evaluating Automation Tasks}
\MYHEADERS{Homework Assignment Four}{Due: October 10 and 11, 2013}

\section*{Introduction}

The last laboratory assignment introduced Tasker, a ``total automation system for Android''.  Since we will continue to
use Tasker in this laboratory assignment, you may want to continue to learn more about it by visiting
\url{http://tasker.dinglisch.net/}. Moreover, in the first laboratory assignment we saw that it was possible to
customize the Android mobile operating system by installing programs such as DashClock and Power Toggles.  In this
laboratory assignment, we will learn more about how to invoke automation tasks from mobile apps such as DashClock.
