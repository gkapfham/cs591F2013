\section*{Introduction}

In the last two homework assignments you have learned more about the Android operating system, with a particular focus
on the AppInventor development environment. Since we will continue to use AppInventor in this laboratory assignment, you
may want to continue to learn more about it by visiting \url{http://appinventor.org/}.  Now, for this homework
assignment, you will work in teams of four or five students to describe, design, implement, test, and evaluate a
complete mobile app in AppInventor.  Over the next two weeks, you will be responsible for organizing a team and then
working with your team members to complete an app that provides useful and exciting features.
